That sounds like a fun and engaging game! Here‚Äôs a basic outline of how you could structure it:

Start Screen: Display a start screen with the game title and a ‚ÄúStart Game‚Äù button.

Quiz Section: When the game starts, present the user with a quiz question. If they answer correctly, award them a token.

Battle Section: After the quiz, move to the battle section. The user can use their tokens to defeat enemies. Each enemy requires a certain number of tokens (representing swords) to defeat.

Enemy Encounters: The user encounters enemies one by one. If an enemy has more swords than the user has tokens, the user loses a life.

Final Boss: The final enemy has 200 swords. The user needs to accumulate enough tokens to defeat this enemy.

End Screen: If the user defeats all enemies, display a ‚ÄúYou Won‚Äù message. If the user loses all their lives before defeating all enemies, display a ‚ÄúYou Lost‚Äù message.

Remember, this is just a basic outline. You can add more features and details to make your game more interesting and challenging! Happy coding! üòä

Adding sound effects to your game can greatly enhance the user experience. Here‚Äôs a basic way to add sound effects using JavaScript:

Create a new sound object: You can create a new object constructor to handle sound objects. Here‚Äôs an example of how you can do this:
JavaScript

function sound(src) {
    this.sound = document.createElement("audio");
    this.sound.src = src;
    this.sound.setAttribute("preload", "auto");
    this.sound.setAttribute("controls", "none");
    this.sound.style.display = "none";
    document.body.appendChild(this.sound);
    this.play = function(){
        this.sound.play();
    }
    this.stop = function(){
        this.sound.pause();
    }
}
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
In the above code, src is the source of your sound file1.

Play the sound: You can play the sound by calling the play method on your sound object. For example, if you have a sound object for a ‚Äòjump‚Äô sound effect, you could play the sound when the player jumps:
JavaScript

var jumpSound = new sound("jump.mp3");
jumpSound.play();
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
In the above code, "jump.mp3" is the source of your ‚Äòjump‚Äô sound file1.

Remember to replace "jump.mp3" with the path to your actual sound file1.

This is a simple way to add sound effects. Depending on the complexity of your game, you might need more advanced audio handling1.
